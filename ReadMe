Requires both OpenCV and FLTK to be built: "sudo make -f makeDependencies threads=#" with # being replaced by a thread amount no more than your processor's amount
	Afterwards, if all goes perfectly, just run make


Note: if you are having trouble with libfaac-dev, then run this line of code:
	"sudo sed -i "$ a\deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian jessie main non-free" /etc/apt/sources.list"

	It will add a source that apt will look at (only a fix for Debian Linux and maybe Ubuntu, though that is untested)
